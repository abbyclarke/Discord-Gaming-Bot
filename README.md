# Discord-Gaming-Bot *Boldly Bronze Bot*
My friends and I enjoy playing video games together, but we frequently waste a lot of time deciding which game to play.
The Boldly Bronze Bot was created to fix this problem in a fun way. The !game command returns one game at random that matches the user's selected criteria.

## Features
* [X] !gif command listens to search request, uses search terms to find a GIF on GIPHY, returns random matching GIF from top 20 results
* [X] !game command asks how many people will be playing and if the user prefers PVP or PVE games, then suggests a game to play
* [X] Various smaller commands (!hello to say hello to the bot, !add to add numbers, !help to see list of commands, etc.)

Ideas to add next:
* [] Create a more detailed game schema, allowing the user to be more specific about which type of game they would like to play
* [] Command that allows users to search for and play music in the voice channel
